# Simulator

## Overview

This page describes the specifications of the simulator used in the AI Challenge.

The simulator is based on the open-source autonomous driving simulator "[AWSIM](https://github.com/tier4/AWSIM)" developed for Autoware.

## Commandline Options

| Option     | Type   | Default    | Description                                           |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| --timeout  | float  | 420.0      | Set session timeout seconds.                          |
| --endless  | bool   | false      | Enable/disable session timeout.                       |
| --pit-stop | bool   | true       | Enable/disable features related to pit-stop.          |
| --replay0  | string |            | Load driving logs and replay as a different vehicle.  |

Use `result-details.json` for the driving log for replay. Also, replay supports 10 vehicles from `--replay0` to `--replay9`.

### Wheel Colliders

The vehicle has a total of four wheel colliders - one for each wheel, simulating the vehicle on a four-wheel model, rather than a kinematic bicycle model.

![wheel-collider](./images/wheel-collider.png)

The Wheel Collider is set as follows. For more details on wheel colliders, please refer to [this manual](https://tier4.github.io/AWSIM/Components/Vehicle/EgoVehicle/#wheels-colliders).
