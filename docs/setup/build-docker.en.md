# Building and Running the Competition Repository

In the competition repository, the actual runtime environment is provided entirely within Docker. The steps to use the repository are as follows:

1. Build the Docker image for the competition environment
2. Build Autoware within the Docker container
3. Run Autoware and the simulator simultaneously within the Docker container

## Building the Docker Image for the Competition Environment

Open a terminal again using `Alt+Ctrl+T`. Follow the commands below by pasting them with `Ctrl+Shift+P` and pressing `Enter`.

First, navigate to the competition repository.

```bash
cd ~/aichallenge-2024
```

Build the Docker image.

```bash
./docker_build.sh dev
```

Check if the following image has been generated by running:

```bash
docker images
```

You should see an image like this:

```txt
aichallenge-2024-dev   latest   df2e83a20349   33 minutes ago   8.9GB
```

## Building Autoware within the Docker Container

Start the Docker container by executing the following:

```bash
cd ~/aichallenge-2024
./docker_run.sh dev cpu
```

Although it may not look like anything has changed, the above command moves the environment inside the Docker container. To confirm that you are inside the Docker container, you can run the following command and check if nothing is displayed.

```bash
ls ~
```

Within the Docker container, build Autoware by executing:

```bash
cd /aichallenge
./build_autoware.bash
```

## Running Autoware and the Simulator within the Docker Container

After building Autoware, run the following command:

```bash
./run_evaluation.bash
```

When the screen shown below appears, the startup is complete. To terminate, press CTRL + C in the terminal.

This concludes the environment setup! Next, let's proceed to actual development.
