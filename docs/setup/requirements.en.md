# Recommended Environment

For the PC used in this competition, we recommend the following specifications. While it is possible to run with lower specifications, it may result in unstable execution speeds on the ROS 2 side, causing significant variations in behavior during simulations.

!!! warning

    If you only have a Windows environment, please install Ubuntu 22.04. While it is possible to install Ubuntu on the same disk as your Windows environment, if you are not familiar with the process, you may accidentally damage your Windows environment. Therefore, we strongly recommend purchasing a new external or internal SSD and installing Ubuntu there.
